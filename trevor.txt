DATA SECTION
- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0495-6
- This dataset is comprised of 21,800 observations, with 24 variables.
- The observations consist of basic physical factors such as age, sex, height, and weight as well as other features, such as
  the final report, testing device, testing site, and the ekg scp codes, among many others.
- The most critical variables here are the age, sex, final report, and the ekg scp codes. These variables will be
  the most important determinants in our classification results. Age, sex, and final report are represented in their typical
  forms, were the ekg scp codes are separated into 1 of 3 categories, then further separated into 1 of 74 statements in total
- In terms of how this data will be handled for our project, there are a few variables that have very little population
  in comparison to the dataset size, so we will have to drop some columns altogether due to lack of data and relevance
  for those variables. Once we start the coding for our models and optimizations, we might have to transform the ekg scp codes
  to be better separated or to group them into larger classes.

PROJECT TIMELINE PROPOSAL
2/25 - Search, discuss and finalize the dataset(s) with the group.
3/1 - Each member completes their own peer review proposal for another group.
3/2 - Import the data and start cleaning, transforming and whatever other operations are necessary to result in a full dataset
3/6 - Discuss the analysis we would like to see performed by our ML model. Make sure the group is on the same page
      in the methods we'd like to incorporate on the dataset to get meaningful results.
3/6 - Begin the coding and actual implementation of these models and whatever metrics we decide to use to measure our performance
3/16 - Complete the code and ensure our objectives have been reached. Make preparations to turn in the project
3/19 - Turn in the final project
